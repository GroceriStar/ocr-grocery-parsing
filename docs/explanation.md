This is an end result that should be: https://github.com/GroceriStar/ocr-grocery-parsing/issues/2

- more details about how our plugin structured
- repository: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch
- documentation: https://groceristar.github.io/groceristar-fetch/

- different grocery lists: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/tree/master/data/Grocery
- more lists: https://github.com/GroceriStar/groceristar-fetch/tree/master/grocery-lists



I'll think that we complete this assignment, when i'll be able to easily grab json file with grocery lists - move it to our fetch plugin and import our data from that file into our server.
