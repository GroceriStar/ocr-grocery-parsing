Groceristar is a project that we're building. Briefly it's a shopping list(grocery list management) app.
At the begining we have only one grocery list at our database - Ultimate Grocery List template.

it's a huge template as you can see. it has big amount of data(this is why it's called Ultimate).
But for most of our daily cases - we don't need all of this data.
So when we has only one template in our system - people need to delete a lot of unnecessary items from their personal lists.

And I think it'll be good feature to have more template that people can use at GroceriStar project.

You can find a lot of grocery lists online. 

When we'll add more specific templates, that oriented to vegan food, healty habits, diabetics food - it'll really benefit to our users.

For Jan, 2019 we have 8-15 grocery list templates, that we're converted to json format and using at our projects.

When i made my research, i find at least 200 different grocery lists. I save URLS for some of them.
But i think it'll be very dumb idea to copy-paste this data into our database. I think it can be better done with Machine Learning algorythms.
So this is a main idea behind creating our image parcing script.
